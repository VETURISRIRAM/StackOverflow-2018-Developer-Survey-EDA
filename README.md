# StackOverflow-2018-Developer-Survey-EDA

This contains various interesting exploratory insights that I drew from the 'Developer Survey 2018' released by StackOverflow. </br>

You can also find the dataset in Kaggle <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/stack-overflow-2018-developer-survey'>here</a>

## Python Notebook doesn't load?

If the Python Notebook does not load in the browser or you see something like `Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?`, you can open it <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/VETURISRIRAM/StackOverflow-2018-Developer-Survey-EDA/blob/master/DeveloperSurveyExploration.ipynb">here<a>.
